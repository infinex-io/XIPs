## Simple Summary
hello this is a test 
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

List wstETH on Synthetix Perps

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the XIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the XIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This is proposal to list Wrapped Staked Ether from Lido futures on Synthetix Perps

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the XIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the XIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the XIP will address the issue!-->

wstETH is wrapped version of stETH from Lido which does not rebase. It has been used in L2 and other L1. This proposal seek to list wstETH/sUSD futures as a way to hedge onchain. This futures has been requested by Pyth and Lido.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

wstETH is avaliable to borrow from following borrowing protocol:

| Chain    | Protocol    |
|----------|-------------|
| Ethereum | AAVE V3     |
| Polygon  | AAVE V3     |
| Arbitrum | AAVE V3     |
| Optimism | AAVE V3     |
| Ethereum | Spark       |
| Arbitrum | Radiant V2  |
| Ethereum | dForce      |
| Optimism | Exactly     |
| Gnosis   | Agave       |
| Optimism | Sonne       |
| Ethereum | Strike      |
| Ethereum | Silo        |
| Arbitrum | Dolomite    |
| Arbitrum | dForce      |
| Arbitrum | Lodestar V1 |
| Optimism | dForce      |
| Optimism | Granary     |

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

wstETH is a widely-used form of stETH on other L1 and L2 rollup. It can be borrowed across multiple platform and other variant has been listed on Synthetix Perps.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The perp market will be deployed with Pyth and Chainlink price feed.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for XIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
